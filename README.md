# Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Data

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing social media data to understand public sentiment towards various brands and products. By employing machine learning and natural language processing techniques, we classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments and analyze trends over time to forecast future sentiment shifts. This analysis can offer invaluable insights for businesses looking to adapt their strategies based on consumer sentiment.

## Objectives
- To perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets related to different brands/products.
- To classify the sentiment of tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.
- To identify trends in sentiment over time.
- To forecast future sentiment trends using time series analysis.

## Methodology
The project employs several data science techniques, outlined as follows:
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Cleaning the text data, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Using the TF-IDF vectorization method and Logistic Regression to classify the sentiment of tweets.
- **Trend Analysis**: Aggregating sentiment scores over time to identify trends.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Applying time series forecasting techniques to predict future sentiment trends.

## Results
- The analysis revealed a predominance of [positive/negative/neutral] sentiment across the dataset.
- Trend analysis indicated [an increase/a decrease/a fluctuation] in [particular sentiment] over [specified time period].
- Predictive analytics suggest [expected trend] in public sentiment towards the analyzed brands/products in the upcoming [time frame].
